## Stylebot

A Google Chrome extension that allows users to manipulate a web pageâ€™s appearance in a WYSIWYG manner.

* Incrementally build custom stylesheets for Chrome.
* Save custom CSS rules for sites. The next time they visit a site, their custom CSS is already applied.
* Share, explore and apply CSS created by other users (_website is currently down_)

## About

This project began as a [Google Summer of Code project](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2010/09/changing-look-of-web-with-stylebot.html) back in 2010. It is currently under limited support since I am the only primary maintainer for the project. I do plan to refresh the project at some point of time in the future.

## Browser support

Stylebot is only supported on Google Chrome. Cross-browser support is unlikely in the future due to limited resources.

## License

Dual licensed under the GPL and MIT Licenses.
